# S3 - Testing

For tests that run against the [AWS S3 service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) you need to provide the relevant credentials
to S3. The most typical way to provide these credentials is with the usage of environment variables, e.g.

```shell
export ALPAKKA_S3_AWS_CREDENTIALS_PROVIDER=static
export ALPAKKA_S3_AWS_CREDENTIALS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="my key"
export ALPAKKA_S3_AWS_CREDENTIALS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="my secret"
export ALPAKKA_S3_REGION_PROVIDER=static
export ALPAKKA_S3_REGION_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-central-1
```

## Tagging S3 Tests

Due to a current limitation where there is no way to expose Github secrets to PR's made from external forks, tests which
run against S3 need to be @extref:[Tagged](scalatest:Tag.html)
using @github[RealS3Available](/core-s3/src/test/scala/io/aiven/guardian/kafka/s3/S3Spec.scala#L45-L48).
