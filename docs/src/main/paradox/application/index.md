# Application

Guardian also becomes packaged as various application/s that lets you run it using a CLI interface. Currently, the
binaries provided are

* restore: A continuously running binary that performs the restore operation.
* backup: A binary which when executed allows you to restore an existing backup.

The CLI follows POSIX guidelines which means you can use `--help` as an argument to provide information on all of the
parameters.
