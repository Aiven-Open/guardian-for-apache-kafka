# Guardian for Apache Kafka Documentation

Guardian for Apache Kafka is an open source utility for backing up [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) clusters.
It is built using [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) entirely
with [Akka-Streams](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/index.html)
to ensure that the tool runs reliably and as desired with large datasets in different scenarios.
